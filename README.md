This site was [original](https://github.com/stefani-gifta/browser-ui/tree/main/original%20Carrd%20screenshots)ly built on [Carrd](https://carrd.co/). However, Carrd couldn't support the full vision I had in mind, and the idea lingered. I tried to let it go, but it didn't let me goâ€”so here we are.
